# Applied Research Scientist

We are seeking an Applied Research Scientist to push the science of evaluating AI agents through simulation. You’ll work on problems at the frontier of agent evaluation, scenario generation, and safety, building environments where agentic workflows can be stress-tested, red-teamed, and improved.

This is a hands-on role: you’ll design evaluation environments, invent new methods for synthetic scenario generation, and contribute directly to the product shaping the future of iterating on agentic systems.

Some of the work will include

- Building simulations and automatic evaluators to debug agentic workflows
- Developing optimisation algorithms to align LLM-based evaluators with human assessments.
- Develop methods for synthetic scenario generation.
- Publish research in top-tier venues (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.) and contribute to the open-source community.

You may be a good fit ..

- You have a keen interest in reading research, identifying patterns, and striking a balance between critical evaluation and openness to novel solutions.
- Strong track record of research in LLM agents, RL, simulation, or evaluation frameworks (publications, projects, or GitHub repos)
- You enjoy and have contributed in open-source and Kaggle.

We believe the next wave of engineers building AI applications deserve the best tools to help bring their ideas to the world. We work really hard to make that happen.If that sounds fun to you do apply at [jobs@explodinggradients.com](mailto:jobs@explodinggradients.com) with short note on a project you’re proud of.
